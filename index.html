            <h4>Project - User Interface for Audio Playback in a Car</h4>
            <h5>March – Avgust 2024</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a multi-platform user interface for an in-car audio playback system using the
                    Flutter UI framework, ensuring compatibility with the Wayland platform and optimizing the app for
                    seamless operation across eLinux-based embedded systems.</li>
                <li>Optimized the app’s memory usage and performance, particularly on embedded hardware such as
                    Telechips, reducing load times and ensuring smooth audio playback across various hardware
                    configurations.</li>
                <li>Worked closely with cross-functional teams to ensure successful deployment of the application on
                    target hardware platforms, utilizing Flutter’s embedded system capabilities alongside Yocto Project tools
                    for system configuration and optimization.</li>
                <li>Conducted extensive testing on different embedded devices to ensure consistent user experience and UI
                        scalability, ensuring the app performed optimally on various screen sizes and hardware setups.</li>
